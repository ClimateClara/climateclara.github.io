Hi!

**I am a trained polar climate scientist. I am particularly interested in interactions between ice and ocean and between ice and climate in general. Also, I like to explore ways of communicating scientific research to peers and larger audiences.** 

I am currently working as a project scientist at the [Laboratoire d'Océanographie et du Climat (LOCEAN)](www.locean.ipsl.fr) in the NEMO group on ice-ocean interactions in Antarctica, concerning both ice shelves and sea ice. I am part of the [PEPR project TRACCS](https://pepr-traccs.fr/).

Before, I worked as a postdoctoral scientist at the [Institut des Géosciences de l'Environnement](https://www.ige-grenoble.fr/) with [Nicolas Jourdain](https://nicojourdain.github.io/) on parameterisations of melting at the base of Antarctic ice shelves, as part of the IDEX project DEEP MELT of the University Grenoble Alpes and within the [H2020 PROTECT](https://protect-slr.eu/) project.

After my PhD, I briefly was as a scientific coordinator for [The Earth League](https://the-earth-league.org/), a voluntary international alliance of prominent scientists from world‐class research institutions, who conduct research and advise decision makers about some of the most pressing issues faced by humankind, as a consequence of climate change, depletion of natural resources, land degradation and water scarcity. The topics discussed within the Earth League were exciting so that I realized that I was more interested in being involved creatively in the scientific world than coordinating it.

Before, I conducted my PhD research on: [Rethinking the relationship between the observed, simulated and real Arctic sea-ice](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3165898_3/component/file_3165899/content) concentration, supervised by [Dirk Notz](https://www.ifm.uni-hamburg.de/en/institute/staff/notz.html) and [Lars Kaleschke](https://www.awi.de/en/about-us/service/expert-database/translate-to-english-lars-kaleschke.html) at the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology and Hamburg University. In my thesis, I looked into the Arctic sea-ice evolution in climate models (CMIP5) and developed an observation operator for the Arctic Ocean, as a new method to compare sea ice as observed by satellites and sea ice as simulated by climate models.

I find (polar) climate science and the scientific process exciting. However, I also think that more communication is necessary within the scientific community and from the scientific community to a more general public. In past years, I was involved in several initiatives promoting knowledge transfer with different formats, e.g. as chief-editor for the [EGU Cryosphere Blog](https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/cr/), as a co-developer for several serious games, as a member of the Twitter editorial team at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, and at the Hamburger Nacht des Wissens.
