_As a complement to scientific research, I am interested in developing new ways to communicate science to peers and a larger audience._

In the media
------------

- Interview for the [IPSL News](https://open.spotify.com/show/4TWj2uXMHzaNr1ZCzlHQki) podcast: "[Montée des eaux: comment modéliser la fonte des glaciers](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0sa6tkccadv8NrsChCYggh?si=e27a9ac4912d44b7&nd=1&dlsi=e38db5335e9745fc)"
- Presentation on recommendations on public research and memory policy as part of [Generation Europe](https://www.ofaj.org/programmes-formations/generation-europe#1) at a [colloquium of the French-German parliament at the Assemblée Nationale](https://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dyn/16/organes/europe-international/apfa/actualites/colloque-etat-des-lieux-de-la-cooperation-franco-allemande-le-18-mars-2024-a-l-assemblee-nationale)

**Climate scarf**

Instructions to knit a climate stripes scarf can be found [here](https://claraburgard.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/1/1/131116144/instructions_climate_scarf.pdf).

**Co-developer of the educational escape game "Save the glaciers" within [H2020 PROTECT](https://protect-slr.eu/educational-material/)**

Save the glaciers! is an educational escape game designed for teenagers (11-18 years old) to learn what glaciers are, how they move, how they react to climate change and what we can do to slower their melt. You can play an online here or print a real-world version (in [English](https://cloud.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/s/p6ocqw37qctidgy) or [French](https://cloud.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/s/BoHmescjdADkEK3))!

**Support in storywriting and illustrations as well as subtitles for the [Science et Climat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCisQk7COaz17d7dg3qSb10Q) Youtube Channel**

Science et Climat is a Youtube channel, initiated by [Mickael Lalande](https://mickaellalande.github.io/), to explain the basics of climate change to a larger audience. I help in the preparation of the storyline of the videos, I provide illustrations, and I prepare most of the non-French subtitles.

**Chief-editor of the [EGU Cryosphere Blog](https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/cr/) (April 2017 to April 2020), author since May 2016**

The cryosphere encompasses all frozen parts of the planet: snow, glaciers, ice sheets, ice caps, sea ice, permafrost,... The EGU Cryosphere Blog is a scientific blog which aims to highlight fun and interesting facts about the cryosphere, explain complex terms employed in cryospheric research, advertise the research of early career researchers in the cryospheric research community, document the life of cryospheric scientists, etc.
As a chief-editor, I was in charge of finding authors to write blog posts so that we could publish one blog post per week. Also, I helped editing the blog posts, in cooperation with the author, to make the structure and vocabulary was as clear as possible.

**Initiator and organisator of the internal Clim*art contest at the Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology 2018 and 2019**

This internal contest had the aim to view scientific figures from an artistic perspective. Especially, we were interested in figures that were scientifically not helpful but looked like abstract art. The submitted figures were printed on canvas and were displayed during the 3-days annual retreat of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology.

**Initiator and coordinator of the Climate Model Calendar 2019 and 2020**

The idea behind the Climate Model Calendar is the many definitions the word "model" can have. In climate science, "model" is associated with computer simulations, in everyday life, it is associated with fashion. We used this double-definition to create a calendar. Early career researchers from Hamburg posed in a setting related to their research topic. The calendar was circulated within the Hamburg Climate Science Community.

**Co-Initiator and Member of the Editorial Team of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Twitter account (January 2018 to December 2019)**

With a couple of other early career researchers, we wrote a proposal for the creation of a Twitter account for the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. This proposal included guidelines to follow and examples of how tweets could look like. It convinced the directors and we worked on establishing an Editorial Team who managed the Twitter account.
The Twitter account @MPI_Meteo has been online since November 2018, aims to tweet daily, and has rapidly gained a high amount of followers. I received a Max Planck bonus for an exceptional contribution from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in June 2019 for this engagement.

**Co-Developer of the role play game "Cold Cooperation" (since June 2017)**

In this game, the global problem of climate change is reduced to the Arctic scale. We assume that the CO2 emissions from the eight countries within the Arctic circle are the only emissions responsible for the melting of the Arctic sea ice and global warming. The different countries have possibilities to reduce their CO2 emissions and to boost their economy. The country which possesses most money tokens at the end of the game wins. This is however only the case if there are still sea-ice floes left. Because, if the sea ice melts completely at any point, everyone looses!
The game can be printed out to be played in any place. You can find the game material [here](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/n8tghGRSGg74Hn0).

**Climate scientist at the I.C.E Camp 2018 and 2019, organized by the in.media.vitae Foundation and Arved Fuchs**

The I.C.E camp is a 2-week-long expedition where around 10 teenagers participate to learn about climate change and environmental issues. I held presentations about climate negociations and the IPCC, answered general questions about climate science and played our simulation game Cold Cooperation with them.
More information about the I.C.E. Camp can be found [here](https://imv-foundation.org/ice-camp-mit-arved-fuchs/).

**Animation at Nacht des Wissens 2017 in Hamburg**

In the quiz "Hast du das Zeug zum Polarforscher?", visitors from all ages could test their knowledge about ice!

**Workshop about climate science at Hamburger Schülerkongress 2016, 2017 and support at Hamburger Schülerkongress 2019**

The Schülerkongress is a one-day event at which pupils from all Hamburg meet for workshop about different topics. The 2016, 2017 and 2019 versions were related in different ways to climate change.
More information about the Schülerkongress, now called Klimakongress, can be found [here](https://www.klimakongress.hamburg/).
